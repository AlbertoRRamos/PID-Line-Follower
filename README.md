# PID-Line-Follower

* pid_linefollower.ino is a program for a robot which can follow a curvilinear path. It is directed by a line on a surface, wherein both are of different colors. It uses a PID controller, which makes the robot follow the path (according to the values obtained from a 5 IR sensor-array) using differential drive system. The speeds of the left and right motors are regulated using the correction term obtained from the PID algorithm.
